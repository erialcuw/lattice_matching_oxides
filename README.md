# lattice_matching_oxides

### Executive Summary
The goal of our work is to find lattice-matched oxide films of different crystal types (i.e., rock salt vs perovskite) with high melting points. These constraints provide suitable conditions for high-temperature thermal stability by limiting oxidation, interlayer diffusion, and phase change. To do this, we rely on computed chemical and physical properties from the [**Materials Project Database**](https://materialsproject.org). For more information, please see our peer-reviewed manuscript here:(insert published work). A detailed description of our materials selection process is present in the supplementary section.
