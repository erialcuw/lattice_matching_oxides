# lattice_matching_oxides

The goal of our work is to find lattice-matched oxide films of different crystal types (i.e., rock salt vs perovskite) with high melting points. These constraints provide suitable conditions for high-temperature thermal stability by limiting oxidation, interlayer diffusion, and phase change. For more information, please see our peer-reviewed manuscript here:(insert published work). 


To use our code to find lattice-matched oxide films with different crystal types, please use the following tutorial: [**Finding Lattice-Matched Oxide Films**](find_new_films.ipynb)<br/>
